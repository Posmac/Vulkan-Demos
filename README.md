# VulkanDemos
Vulkan demos, mostly for teaching purporses

Currently the API is created for about every aspect, as:
1. Instance creation
2. Device selection
3. Image presentation
4. Command buffers
5. Syncronization
6. Resources and memory
7. Render passes and framebuffers
8. Shaders 
9. Graphics and compute pipeline creation
10. Command recording
11. Drawing 

Plan is:
1. Refactoring (currently is a unoptimized and unordered mess)
2. Implementing vertex diffuse ligting
3. Implementing fragment specular ligting 
4. Render a normal mapped geometry
5. Drawing a relfective geometry
6. Drawing a refractive geometry
7. Skybox
8. Billboards
9. Particles
10. Tesselation (terrain)
11. Post processing 
12. PBR
This list can(will) be updated in the future as i progress throught vulkan mastering
