# VulkanDemos
:bangbang: This list could be updated in the future as i progress throught vulkan mastering 

Currently the API is created for about every aspect, as:
1. :white_check_mark: Instance creation 
2. :white_check_mark: Device selection 
3. :white_check_mark: Image presentation 
4. :white_check_mark: Command buffers 
5. :white_check_mark: Syncronization
6. :white_check_mark: Resources and memory 
7. :white_check_mark: Render passes and framebuffers 
8. :white_check_mark: Shaders 
9. :white_check_mark: Graphics and compute pipeline creation 
10. :white_check_mark: Command recording 
11. :white_check_mark: Drawing 

Plan is:
1. :white_check_mark: Refactoring (currently is a unoptimized and unordered mess) 
2. :black_large_square: Implementing vertex diffuse ligting 
3. :black_large_square: Implementing fragment specular ligting 
4. :black_large_square: Render a normal mapped geometry
5. :black_large_square: Drawing a relfective geometry 
6. :black_large_square: Drawing a refractive geometry 
7. :black_large_square: Skybox 
8. :black_large_square: Billboards 
9. :black_large_square: Particles 
10. :black_large_square:Tesselation (terrain) 
11. :black_large_square: Post processing 
12. :black_large_square: PBR
